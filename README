# Introduction
A simplified version of ls and mkdir implementation on ext2 file system. 

# Assumptions

# Notes
1. The print out of *ext2_ls* is not as nicely formatted as an usual
*ls* does. It needs work on *print_file* function.
2. *ext2_ls* does not support the doubly or triply i_block links.
3. There might be memory leak problems in the program. Probably due to
missing free() on the malloc'd pointers. 
4. ext2_mkdir only takes for absolute path as the parameters. 

# Credits
1. The implementation is mostly developed from an Operating System
Course assignment. The instructor Karen Raid designed the assignment and wrote a
detailed helpful specificiation for this program.
